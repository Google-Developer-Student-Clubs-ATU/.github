# Howdy fellow,

:seedling: Welcome to Google Developer Student Clubs ATU. We started our journey in Sep 2023 and trying to engage student developers, fresh graduates, and professionals through our hack events & workshops. 
<br><br>:earth_asia: The motive is to create a local ecosystem of programmers & developers in our university. Technology awareness is the main goal for the group's first few years. 
<br><br>:school: The source codes and documents of workshops will be shared on this page. So that everyone can benefit.
<br><br>:ringed_planet: We're currently gathering student fellows for our developing teams. 

### Here is a list of our current teams:
  * AI and Machine Learning
  * Web Development
  * Mobile Application Development 
  * Cyber Security
